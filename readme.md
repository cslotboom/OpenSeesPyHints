# OpenSeesPyHints
A wrapper around the OpenSeesPy libray that contains docstrings and easier function calls.
All commands can be mixed with basic OpenSeesPy commands.

# a basic example:
```Python
python:ex/WebsiteDemo.py

```

Currently being built and tested. The build status of commands is as follows:

# model
 -[x]   element
 -[x]   node
 -[x]   SP_Constraint
 -[x]   mp_constraint
 -[x]   pc
 -[x]   timeSeries
 -[x]   pattern
 -[x]   mass
 -[x]   region
 -[x]   reyleigh
 -[x]   block
 -[x]   beamIntegration
 -[x]   uniaxialMaterial
 -[x]   ndMaterial
 -[x]   section
 -[x]   frictionModel
 -[x]   geomTransf

# [x] Analysis
# [] Ouput
# [x] Utility
# [] FSI
# [] Sensitivity
# [] Relieability
# [] Parallel

Once built, commands should be tested and compared to their original OpenSeesPy counterpart.
Commands untested are labeled as such.
