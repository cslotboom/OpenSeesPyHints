.. function:: setStartNodeTag(ndtag)

  Set the starting node tag for the :doc:`mesh`.
  The purpose of this command is to control
  the node tags generated by the :doc:`mesh`. Some
  nodes are shared by processors, which must
  have same tags. Nodes which are unique to
  a processor must have uniques tags across
  all processors.
