#. This is a simple model of an elastic portal frame with EQ ground motion and gravity loading. Here the structure is excited using uniform excitation load pattern
#. All units are in kip, inch, second
#. To run EQ ground-motion analysis, :download:`BM68elc.acc</pyExamples/EarthquakeExamples/Example1b/BM68elc.acc>` needs to be downloaded into the same directory)
#. The source code is shown below, which can be downloaded :download:`here </pyExamples/EarthquakeExamples/Example1b/Example1b.py>`.
#. The detailed problem description can be found `here <http://opensees.berkeley.edu/wiki/index.php/Examples_Manual>`_  (example: 1b)
