 Generic Model Module
======================

- Generic Model is the most flexible module for
  writing Python script to create a model.

- The import of OpenSeesPy is optional

- Every ``OpenSeesPy`` command should be called as::

    ops.command

- When a Generic Model is run, the model should be displayed in the viewer.

.. note::

   - The :doc:`runAllModel` will run all models.
   - The :doc:`runOneModel` will just run the selected model.
